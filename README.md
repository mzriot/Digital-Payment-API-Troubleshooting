# Digital-Payment-API-Troubleshooting (MDES)

This project simulates the end-to-end process of digital tokenization in a modern payment ecosystem, inspired by Mastercard Digital Enablement Service (MDES). It is designed from a support analyst's perspective, focusing on understanding, diagnosing, and simulating real-world tokenization workflows.

The project includes:

A simplified tokenization flowchart
Simulated API flows using Postman (e.g., token requests, payment submissions, error cases)
Sample log files demonstrating token-related issues
A troubleshooting guide for analyzing failures such as expired tokens, malformed requests, and device binding errors
This project highlights practical skills in:

Digital payment infrastructure
MDES-based tokenization concepts
API debugging using tools like Postman, cURL, Splunk, Fiddler
Log analysis and issue documentation for recurring incidents
It is intended to demonstrate both technical acumen and real-world support readiness in the digital payments domain.
